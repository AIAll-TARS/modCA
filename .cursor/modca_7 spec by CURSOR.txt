# modca_7 (modca_o7) Specification

## Overview
modca_7 is a cellular automata-based ecosystem simulation that models complex interactions between predators, prey, and substrate in a 2D grid environment. The system implements a probabilistic model where entities behave according to configurable rules, allowing for emergent ecosystem behaviors.

## System Architecture

### Core Components:
1. **Grid System**: A 2D square grid where each cell can contain one entity (predator, prey, substrate, or empty).
2. **Entity Types**:
   - **Predators**: Hunt prey and reproduce when successful
   - **Prey**: Consume substrate, reproduce, and avoid predators
   - **Substrate**: Appears randomly and serves as a food source for prey
   - **Empty**: Empty cells that can be moved into or host new entities

3. **Simulation Engine**: Manages the simulation life cycle, updating the grid state according to predefined rules.
4. **Visualization System**: Renders the grid and population trends in real-time.
5. **Database System**: Stores user configuration settings in SQLite.
6. **GUI**: Provides an interactive interface for configuration and control.

### Technical Stack:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **NumPy**: For efficient grid operations and mathematical calculations
- **Matplotlib**: For population trend visualization
- **Tkinter**: For the graphical user interface
- **SQLite3**: For configuration storage

## Detailed Module Specifications

### 1. Grid Module (`grid.py`)
- Creates and manages the 2D grid structure (size NxN)
- Initializes the grid with entities based on configuration
- Provides utility functions for:
  - Finding empty neighboring cells
  - Counting specific entity types in neighborhoods
  - Determining neighbor coordinates based on neighborhood type

### 2. Simulation Module (`simulation.py`)
- Implements the simulation logic and state transitions
- Manages entity behaviors with the following rules:
  
  **Predator Rules**:
  - Die with probability `predator_death_probability`
  - Hunt prey with probability `prey_hunted_probability`
  - Reproduce after successful hunting with probability `predator_birth_probability`
  - Move to empty cells when no prey is available

  **Prey Rules**:
  - Die randomly with probability `prey_random_death`
  - Attempt to escape when predators are nearby
  - Consume substrate with probability `substrate_consumption_prob`
  - Reproduce after consuming substrate with probability `prey_birth_probability`
  - Move randomly when no substrate is available

  **Substrate Rules**:
  - Appear in empty cells with a reduced probability (1/10 of `initial_substrate_probability`)
  - Disappear randomly with probability `substrate_random_death`
  - Be consumed by prey

  **Empty Cell Rules**:
  - Can become substrate with a small probability

- Tracks statistics throughout the simulation

### 3. Constants Module (`constants.py`)
- Defines default parameter values for all simulation aspects:
  - Grid parameters: Size (100Ã—100), steps (100), neighborhood type ("von_neumann")
  - Predator parameters: Death probability (0.05), birth probability (0.33), initial count (3)
  - Prey parameters: Hunted probability (0.7), random death (0.01), birth probability (0.7), initial count (2000)
  - Substrate parameters: Initial probability (0.25), random death (0.03), consumption probability (0.6)
  - Entity representation constants (0=empty, 1=prey, 2=predator, 3=substrate)
  - Visualization colors

### 4. GUI Module (`gui.py`)
- Implements a Tkinter-based interface with:
  - Parameter configuration controls
  - Simulation control buttons (start, pause, stop)
  - Real-time grid visualization
  - Population trend graphs
  - Settings management (save/load)

### 5. Database Module (`db_handler.py`)
- Manages SQLite database operations for:
  - Storing user configuration settings
  - Loading saved settings
  - Managing database connections

### 6. Visualization Module (`visualization.py`)
- Renders the grid state using matplotlib
- Creates population trend graphs
- Exports visualization data to image files

### 7. Main Module (`main.py`)
- Entry point for the application
- Initializes the GUI and starts the main event loop
